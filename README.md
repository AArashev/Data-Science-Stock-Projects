This project delves into the predictive power of machine learning by employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast the closing stock prices of Apple Inc. By leveraging historical stock price data, this deep learning approach aims to provide a forward-looking perspective on market trends, focusing specifically on the 60-day price movements leading up to predictions. The endeavor showcases the application of LSTM networks in deciphering complex patterns within time-series data, demonstrating their potential to offer valuable insights for financial forecasting. Through this project, we explore the integration of advanced machine learning techniques in the financial domain, illustrating the LSTM model's capability to navigate the intricacies of stock market fluctuations and predict future price trajectories.
